### Portfolio (2025)
## What's different from the original?
- This portfolio website is being deployed on a server that has an Intel Core Duo processor and 2GB of ram
- Meaning, this application needs to be LIGHT and EFFICIENT
- The challenge here is to not use a framework to create a reactive, yet light application

## What's the Stack?
- GoLang for the Backend
- HTML/CSS/JS for the Frontend

## What's the Server?
- A more than a decade old, Dell Optiplex 780 (2009)
- 2GB RAM (of some MHz)
- A 5 year old 256GB Kingston SSD
- Intel Core Duo processor (...I think)
- OS: Ubuntu Server 22.04 
- Deployed in my living room
